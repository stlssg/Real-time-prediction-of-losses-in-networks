# Real-time prediction of losses in networks

#### Real-time communication (RTC) platforms have seen a consistent increase in popularity in recent years, together with the spread of broadband Internet access. Nowadays, they are fundamental for both work and leisure purposes, with remote working becoming a normality and video calls substituting traditional telephony. In this context, it is particularly important to act at network level to insure adequate Quality of Experience (QoE) to users, where proper traffic management policies are needed to prioritize RTC traffic. One of the main adversaries of good QoE is packet loss. We propose a system for predicting losses in RTP stream traffic, in the near future (next second). For the task, we analyse a myriad of ML algorithms, from standard techniques, to Deep neural networks and Anomaly detection algorithms. We build our study on more than 66 hours of data from two popular RTC applications. One of the main challenges for the prediction lies in the imbalance between the traffic with losses and without losses and we try to combat this with various optimization techniques. We reach an overall recall of 0.82 using a Balanced Random Forest classifier.
